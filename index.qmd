This is my Quarto website, created for my first assignment in Foundations of Data Science! Although this site only contains classwork now, I hope to further develop it as a landing page for my art portfolio, contains poetry, documentaries, digital art, and motion pictures, along with my more pride-inducing research papers, and perhaps, even a resume.
