    "text": "This is a faceted bar chart demonstrating different eating habits across nations as it pertains to cheese. We can see that cows are substantially more centered in the dairy industry, while other milks, like water buffalo, go relatively unnoticed. You can also see countries in multiple different groups demonstrating both the breadth and nicheness of their cheeses, Italy being particularly noticible in this regard.\nTidyTusedy dataset: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/a95bcce0d7e09590519ba1ff98512fbf10f443af/data/2024/2024-06-04\nData origins: cheese.com, a blog and resource for cheese lovers, collected this data."

    "text": "Hi, I’m Jazzmin Pearl Duncan—a media science student, writer, and curator passionate about the intersections of technology, digital media, and music culture. With a background in research, data teams, and storytelling, I explore how emerging technologies shape media production, intellectual property, and cultural expression.\nI’m the Founder and Production Manager of Circuits, Internet, Media & Software (CIMS), a collective dedicated to celebrating the fusion of media and computer science through events, publications, and community-driven projects. My work spans journalism, law and policy writing, and software projects that engage with digital culture in innovative ways.\nCurrently, I’m contributing to p-RoomMatch, a smart roommate-matching platform, as part of the data team, and I’m a staff writer for the Claremont Journal of Law & Public Policy, where I focus on AI’s impact on music licensing and intellectual property law. I’m also a DJ, event planner, and multimedia artist with a love for experimental sounds, textile work, and digital collaging.\nThrough my work, I aim to blend technical insight with creative vision, fostering spaces where media, technology, and culture collide in meaningful ways.\nLet’s connect and collaborate!"
